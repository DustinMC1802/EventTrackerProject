## Overview
This project was my first exploration for using Angular in order to create a front end for my Job Applcation Tracker. It is a simple web page but includes basic bootstrap and CRUD functionality.

## New Technologies Used
* TypeScript
* Visual Studio Code
* Angular

## Lessons Learned
Using Angular to create a front end is a very intuitive and efficient system. It still feels pretty new though, and I look forward to getting more practice as I prepare for my self-paced education after I graduate from Skill Distillery.
